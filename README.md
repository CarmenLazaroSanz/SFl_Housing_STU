# SFl_Housing_STU
Who: Me! Carmen Lazaro Sanz 
What: Analyzing through visualization the prices of Luxury Housing in South Florida from three different counties. Comparing the impact of number of rooms, bathrooms, waterfront, schools, etc. 
Where: At St Thomas University - Data Visualization. 
When: Spring 2023 
Why: Since Covid has had such an impact on the real estate market I wanted to take a closer look at the luxury real estate market since south Florida has a great variety. Now, Fall 2023, it is estimated that this year will be the lowest in sales compared to the last few years. For that reaosn I wanted to see the grwoth and compare and contrast where do we stand realtive to before the pandemic.
