# SFl_Housing_STU
Hi! This project was completed in May of 2023 for my Data Visualization class at ST Thomas University for my MS. The database provided details of propeties sold in South Florida.

Since Covid has had such an impact on the real estate market I wanted to take a closer look at the luxury real estate market since south Florida has a great variety. Now, Fall 2023, it is estimated that this year will be the lowest in sales compared to the last few years. For that reaosn I wanted to see the grwoth and compare and contrast where do we stand realtive to before the pandemic. 

When preparing the data, First I prepared and cleaned the database I found to be able to find better correlations and be able to create significant graphs. Then I was able to analyze through visualization the prices of Luxury Housing in South Florida for the three different counties. Comparing the impact of number of rooms, bathrooms, waterfront, schools, etc.
